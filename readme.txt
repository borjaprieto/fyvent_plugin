fyvent gives any site base capabilities to implement an online citizen participation program. There are auxiliary plugins for
participatory processes like citizen proposals, debates or polls.

== Description ==

There are some solutions already for implementing online citizen participation, most notably [CONSUL](https://consulproject.org)   and  [Decidim](https://decidim.org). But usually these solutions are quite difficult to implement, and require advance IT knowledge.

fyvent started as a WordPress-based clone of the participation site of the city of Madrid, [Decide Madrid](https://decide.madrid.es) which is based on CONSUL.

The goal of this project is to provide an alternative to CONSUL that is easier to deploy, maintain and adapt to the needs of the city implementing the software. This should lower significantly the entry barrier, as deploying a Ruby-on-Rails based solution like CONSUL or Decidim involves deploying a whole set of software that is not common in many municipalities and as such is challenging for them.

fyvent makes use of the whole WordPress environment, including user management, plugins, themes, etc. The fyvent theme has been created specifically to address the front-end functionality of the fyvent System, and it proposes the installation of this and other fyvent plugins. You can use this theme or develop your own.
